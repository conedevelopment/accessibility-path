# Accessibility Path

Accessibility Path is a collection of resources that can help you to learn web accessibility and inclusive design.

Learning accessibility can be hard and require dedication. You can't learn (if it is possible) this fast. It would help if you had the time and useful learning materials. I started learning last year (2019) from different sources, and although I read many books, watched courses, videos, and read a lot of articles, it is still hard to put the pieces together.

Collecting and filtering the most suitable resources can differ per person, but still, we can obtain the better ones. I hope this list (mostly show my learning path) will help you start and keep up with learning because one thing is sure it is worth it.

## Books to Read

*Books are a great resource and starting point as always. In the field of web accessibility we have some excellent guidelines for any level.*

* [Accessibility for Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone) - I think this is the best book to start with. Not too heavy but thorough, and it will give you a strong foundation.
* [A Web for Everyone](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/a-web-for-everyone/) - An excellent way to approach accessibility is through user experience. UX is a broad concept that includes a11y and usability. In this book, you can view this topic from a user experience view. 
* [Just Ask: Integrating Accessibility Throughout Design](http://uiaccess.com/accessucd/) - An older book about the accessibility theory. Start to think as an inclusive specialty who universally cares about usability.
* [Form Design Patterns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/form-design-patterns/) - The forms are essential elements on the interactive web. Everybody wants to build better and more accessible ones; with this practical book, you can make too.
* [Inclusive Design Patterns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/inclusive-front-end-design-patterns/) - A practical book about how to build inclusive front-end with various patterns.
