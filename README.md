# Accessibility Path - Learn About Inclusive Design

**Accessibility Path is a collection of resources that can help you to learn web accessibility and inclusive design. It is also my learning path of learning this topic too. So this set of resources could be opinionated because these are what I found helpful on my journey. Indeed, there is much more learning material to explore.**

Learning accessibility can be tricky and require dedication. You can't learn this fast (but this can be true for everything); it can be dry. It will help if you have time and helpful learning materials. I started learning in 2019 from different sources, and although I read many books, watched courses, videos, and read articles, it is still hard to put the pieces together. Two things worth more, although - as always - practice it in real projects and write about it.

Collecting and filtering the most suitable resources can differ per person, but we can still obtain better ones. I hope this list will help you start and keep up with learning because one thing is sure it is worth it.
