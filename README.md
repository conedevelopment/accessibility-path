# Accessibility Path - Resources To Learn About Inclusive Design

Accessibility Path is a collection of resources that can help you to learn web accessibility and inclusive design. It is also my learning path of learning this topic too. So this set of resources could be opinionated because these are what I found helpful on my journey. Indeed, there is much more learning material to explore.

Learning accessibility can be tricky and require dedication. You can't learn this fast (but this can be true for everything); it can be dry. It will help if you have time and helpful learning materials. I started learning in 2019 from different sources, and although I read many books, watched courses, videos, and read articles, it is still hard to put the pieces together. Two things worth more, although - as always - practice it in real projects and write about it.

Collecting and filtering the most suitable resources can differ per person, but we can still obtain better ones. I hope this list will help you start and keep up with learning because one thing is sure it is worth it.

*Books are a great resource and starting point as always. In the field of web accessibility we have some excellent guidelines for any level.*

* [Accessibility for Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone) - I think this is the best book to start with. Not too heavy but thorough, and it will give you a strong foundation.
* [A Web for Everyone](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/a-web-for-everyone/) - An excellent way to approach accessibility is through user experience. UX is a broad concept that includes a11y and usability. In this book, you can view this topic from a user experience view.
